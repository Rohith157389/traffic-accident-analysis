Traffic Accident Data Analysis & Visualization

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.  
The goal is to explore contributing factors and visualize accident hotspots using data analysis techniques.

 Project Objective
The objectives of this project are:
- Clean and preprocess accident dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns in accidents based on weather, road conditions, and time
- Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors
- Extract meaningful insights from the data

---

Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

 Project Files
- `task_4.ipynb` → Notebook containing preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations
- Accident dataset (loaded inside the notebook)

---

 Data Preprocessing Steps
- Handling missing values
- Cleaning inconsistent data
- Converting date/time features
- Feature selection and formatting

---

Analysis & Visualizations
- Accidents by time of day
- Accidents by weather conditions
- Road condition impact analysis
- Accident frequency distribution
- Heatmaps / hotspot visualization (if included)
- Correlation analysis of factors
